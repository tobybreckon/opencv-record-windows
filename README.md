#  Record OpenCV WIndows - Video Capture via HighGUI display windows _hack_

Requires [OpenCV 3.x](http://www.opencv.org).

---

```
// Record OpenCV Window Display to Movie File
// a.ka. a Video Capture via HighGUI display windows hack

// aut (see test.cpp, for instance)omatically records highGUI windows defined with either of:
// namedWindow(), cvNamedWindow() provided all such windows
// are undated in the "main loop" via imshow() or cvShowImage().

// Use: just include this header before all your code **including** the opencv
// header (#include <cv.h>, #include <opencv2/...>) etc.

// Windows to be recorded (or that are not updated) can be black-listed
// via cvNamedWindowBlackList(windowName) (C) or
// via namedWindowBlackList(windowName) (C++). Put these **directly** after
// the corresponding namedWindow() or cvNamedWindow() call

/*  Usage example (see test.cpp, for instance):

< ---- START/TOP OF FILE that includes main() / "main display loop"
#include "opencv_record_output.h"

< ----- your regular code including all other headers
#include ....
.....
.....
namedWindowBlackList("controls"); // a window we don't want / cannot capture
.....
cvNamedWindowBlackList("controls"); // as above but for OpenCV C interface
.....
< ---- END OF FILE "that's it, no other code changes needed.

Defaults: output video is 1280x720 max. - see code below to change
